### Hey there, I'm Harkirat👋

- I'm a Computer Science CO-OP student at the University of Guelph. I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and its endless possibilities, which led me to the field of software development with a particular interest in full-stack development and machine learning.

- As a student, I have developed strong leadership, decision-making, analytical and teaching skills through various academic and extracurricular activities. I believe that these skills, combined with my technical knowledge, will allow me to excel in the tech industry and make a positive impact

- Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in modern full-stack technologies for open-source platforms to solve real-world problems and understand machine learning and predictive modelling

- Apart from my academic pursuits, I am very active within the community and enjoy collaborating with new people to learn new things. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set. My passion for technology and dedication to personal growth will drive my success as a software developer.

I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals in the tech community. To connect with me you can check my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hsoomal/ or email me at soomalh4@gmail.com
