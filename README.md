### Hey there, I'm HarkiratðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am a Computer Science CO-OP student at the University of Guelph and I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and its endless possibilities, which led me to the field of software development with a particular interest in software development and testing.

As a student, I have developed strong leadership, decision-making, analytical and teaching skills through various academic and extracurricular activities. I believe that these skills, combined with my technical knowledge, will allow me to excel in the tech industry and make a positive impact

Apart from my academic pursuits, I am very active within the community and enjoy collaborating with new people to learn new things along the way. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skillset, and I believe that my passion for technology and dedication to personal growth will drive my success as a software developer.

I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and am always open to connecting with like-minded individuals in the tech community. To connect with me you can check my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hsoomal/ or email me at soomalh4@gmail.com
